* Collect following data for customer/projid to some "source data folder"
customer/projid/orthophoto/orthophoto_export.tif 
customer/projid/orthophoto/tiles/gdalinfo.txt 
customer/projid/orthophoto/tiles/mapdata.json 
customer/projid/dem/color_relief/color_relief.tif 
customer/projid/dem/color_relief/color_relief.txt

files "gdalinfo.txt" and "mapdata.json" required only if file
customer/projid/orthophoto/user_muckpile.json exist.


* Setup script "PrepareData.py" to "source data folder" and "result data folder"
- As No Customers as no ProjId filenames should not contain dots '.' symbols
- it will create intermediate data in "result data folder"/CURRENT_DATE
- remember path to CURRENT_DATE, because it will be used later during training
- if file "user_muckpile.json" exist, mask-file fill be created

* Put file VIA.html into folder "result data folder"/CURRENT_DATE/masks

* Use VIA.html to create annotations for dataset.
- Pay attention that image resolution could be different to source image resolution(units->meter, particular meter per pixel[mppx])
- To quickly read all images into VIA, copy content of file "result data folder"/CURRENT_DATE/masks/image_list.txt 
into field of VIA dialog "Add File using URL" which appeared by button "Add URL"
- Export result to json-file.

* Setup network by params in "config.py"
